summary: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>We have eleven years left to implement the ambitious 2030 Agenda and to put our world back on a sustainable path that respects the boundaries of our planet, leaving no one behind. To achieve this challenging task, development cooperation needs to undergo a drastic change.</p>"

<p style='text-align: justify;'> In 2015, 193 Member States of the United Nations and the global society agreed on the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Progress of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is measured using 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that capture the social, economic and ecological dimension. Four years into the agenda, what has been the progress achieved in terms of global collaboration and what are the remaining challenges to be tackled in the next eleven years?</p>

## New range of actors and instruments
<p style='text-align: justify;'> The ambition, universality and integrated nature of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development have brought new thinking to the entire development cooperation architecture. It is encouraging that to adapt to the new realities of development cooperation, an advanced range of development actors and instruments emerged going beyond financial resources and encompassing capacity building, technology development and transfer, policy change and multi-stakeholder partnerships. Having evolved from the notion of a North-South divide, the new system captures significant contributions from a diverse range of stakeholders across the whole world, including South-South Cooperation and private sector engagement.</p>

## Country-tailored cooperation is key
<p style='text-align: justify;'> Yet, development cooperation is still adapting. The profound policy and programme integration required by the 2030 Agenda will help countries to articulate their needs since countries and monitor progress. This in turn enables development partners to better target and tailor their support. A transformative focus on sustainable development results and putting the furthest behind first however hinge upon capacity support to strengthen own approaches, capacities and systems in developing countries. At the same time, partner countries need to significantly step up their support as an unprecedented amount of resources is required to realize the 2030 Agenda and to turn the threat of a permanent climate change around.</p>

## Contribution of this blog
<p style='text-align: justify;'> In view of the remaining challenges, this blog will aim at discussing development cooperation and finance from different angles. It will encompass some deep dives into the past as going forward is not possible without looking back. It will give interesting insights into current challenges in development cooperation that can only be solved through joint efforts. At times, it will delve deeper into development cooperation from a German perspective. With passion for evidence-based approaches, I will provide informative infographics whenever feasible. Let's implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development together!
