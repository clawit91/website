summary: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>To fund the operational activities of the United Nations for development, Member States and non-governmental organizations provide regular and voluntary financial contributions. For a more effective service delivery on the ground, the current share of unearmarked contributions to be greatly stepped up.</p>"

## Increased effectiveness of UN operations on the ground

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development puts an even greater emphasis on development effectiveness, policy coherences and cooperation across all levels. This also demands greater action by the United Nations to deliver effective operational activities on the ground. To this effect, the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) was set up in 1997 to enhance the coordination of 32 UN agencies, funds and programmes at country level. Strategies of the UNDG are defined and revised every four years in the 'Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review' (QCPR), whereas progress on the strategy achieved is tracked on an annual basis. As part of this assessment, financial contributions to the operational activities for development are analyzed. </p>

## Core contributions are critical to effective development support

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Contributions can be classified as core and non-core. While core contributions can be used at the sole discretion of the respective UN entity, non-core contributions come with strings attached. Ideally, contributions would be solely composed of core contributions so that the UNDG can take action and coordinate projects. Let us take a closer look at total contributions at country level, and the country's ranking in the share of core contributions (ranging from 0% to 100%). Just hover with the mouse over one country, or search for the country on the upper left of the chart.</p>

## Top UN contributors rely too heavily on non-core funding

<img alt="Top Contibutors" style="float: right" src="../assets/fig2-top-contributors.png" width="300" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Which messages do we take from the map? There are three observations that one can make.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Observation 1: There is a wide spread in financial contributions to the UN development system. The range spreads from net beneficiaries (e.g. Venezuela with -17,000 USD) to net contributors (e.g. the United States of America with 6,000,000 USD). The average amounts to 100,000 USD.</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Observation 2: Core contributions are on average only one third of the total contributions. Especially countries from smaller developing countries seem to provide 100% of unearmarked contributions.</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Observation 3: Only two out of the top 10 net contributors have higher core-than non-core shares (Sweden, Netherlands). Brazil achieves the lowest rate of 8%.</p>

    The funding of operational activities of the UN for development including the core funding of its agencies, funds and programmes

    The regular United Nations budget for the 2018/2019 biennium, approved by the 73rd session of the General Assembly on 22 December 2018, amounts to 5.811 billion US dollars, inclusive of all supplements. The International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY, 98.1 million US dollars) and Rwanda (ICTR, 5.8 million US dollars, transacted in 2016) both have their own regular two‑year budgets, as does the associated International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT, 97,7 million US dollars). These budgets are funded in equal parts from the regular contributions scale and the peacekeeping scale.

The numerous United Nations programmes and funds (UNDP, UNFPA, UNEP, etc.) receive additional financing through voluntary contributions from the member states.

The Development System Reform process will mean significant changes to the setup, leadership, accountability mechanisms and capacities of the whole UN development system; ensuring it meets national needs. not only for implementing the SDGs, but also  in meeting the climate change commitments made through the 2015 Paris Agreement.

More specifically, the reform gives Resident Coordinators – the most senior UN development officials at the country level – a dedicated, independent role in coordinating the activities of all the various UN entities working on behalf of people across the world locally, which make up UN Country Teams.

With the reform, the functions of the Resident Coordinator are now separated from those of the resident representative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP).-->
