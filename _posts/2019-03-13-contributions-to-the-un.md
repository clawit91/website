summary: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>To fund the operational activities of the United Nations for development, Member States and non-governmental organizations provide regular and voluntary financial contributions. For a more effective service delivery on the ground, the current share of unearmarked contributions needs to be stepped up.</p>"

## Increased effectiveness of UN operations on the ground

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development puts an even greater emphasis on development effectiveness, policy coherences and cooperation across all levels. This also demands greater action by the United Nations to deliver effective operational activities on the ground. First efforts were made when the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) was set up in 1997 to enhance the coordination of 32 UN agencies, funds and programmes at country level. The strategic objectives of the UNDG are re-defined every four years in the 'Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review' (QCPR), whereas progress achieved is tracked on an annual basis. As part of this yearly assessment, financial contributions of different stakeholders to the operational activities for development are analyzed. Data from 2013 to 2016 are publicly accessible and downloadable.</p>

## Core contributions are critical for effective development support

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Financial resources can be classified as core or non-core contributions. Core funding provides the highest degree of flexibility to the UN entities as these unearmarked resources can be managed by the respective UN entity on its own, in close coordination with other funds and programmes. Non-core contribution in contrast might lead to fragmentation or overlap. Ideally, contributions would therefore be solely composed of core contributions. In this post, we want to explore total and core contributions of UN Member States to the UNDG. Note that shares of contributions have been calculated in absolute terms to take into account negative values. To obtain individual country information, hover with the mouse over one country or search for the country on the upper left of the chart.</p>

## Top contributors rely too heavily on non-core funding

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In 2016, a total of 21.34 million USD has been contributed to the UN development system by its Member States. But what story do the data tell us at the country level? There are three key observations:</p>

<img alt="Top Contibutors" style="float: right" src="../assets/fig2-top-contributors.png" width="400" hspace="10" vspace="10"/>

<p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Observation 1:</b> There is a wide spread in financial contributions to the UN development system. It ranges from net beneficiaries (Venezuela; -0.17 million USD) to net contributors (USA; 6 million USD), reflecting current geopolitics and conflicts.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Observation 2:</b> Core contributions are on average only one-third of total contributions. Especially countries from smaller country settings (Tonga, Nauru, Suriname, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, the Bahamas, San Marino) provide more than 95% in unearmarked contributions relative to total contributions.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Observation 3:</b> Only two countries out of the top 10 net contributors have higher core than non-core shares (Sweden 56%, the Netherlands 52%), while Brazil achieves the lowest rate of 8%. The USA as the most important contributor in absolute terms provides 14% of its resources through core funding.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>For a more effective programme and service delivery of the UNDG at country level, the flexibility of contributions needs to be increased by switching from non-core to core resources. The top contributors such as the USA, Germany and the United Kingdom have a high leverage to achieve at least an equal share of unearmarked and earmarked financing.</p>

## Digging deeper into the data in future posts

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The publicly available data could be also used to get further insights into contributions at country level. First, funding to the UN development system is displayed in absolute terms. Contributions in relative terms, e.g. pegged to a country's Gross National Product, could provide more detailed information on a country's commitment. Second, the current visualization doesn't differentiate between funding for longer-term development cooperation and humanitarian assistance activities that are delivered on short notice due to catastrophes, conflicts and crises. Third, tracking contributions over time might reveal further insights into priorities. These issues will be dissected in more detail in future posts.</p>

    The funding of operational activities of the UN for development including the core funding of its agencies, funds and programmes

    The regular United Nations budget for the 2018/2019 biennium, approved by the 73rd session of the General Assembly on 22 December 2018, amounts to 5.811 billion US dollars, inclusive of all supplements. The International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY, 98.1 million US dollars) and Rwanda (ICTR, 5.8 million US dollars, transacted in 2016) both have their own regular two‑year budgets, as does the associated International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT, 97,7 million US dollars). These budgets are funded in equal parts from the regular contributions scale and the peacekeeping scale.

The numerous United Nations programmes and funds (UNDP, UNFPA, UNEP, etc.) receive additional financing through voluntary contributions from the member states.

The Development System Reform process will mean significant changes to the setup, leadership, accountability mechanisms and capacities of the whole UN development system; ensuring it meets national needs. not only for implementing the SDGs, but also  in meeting the climate change commitments made through the 2015 Paris Agreement.

More specifically, the reform gives Resident Coordinators – the most senior UN development officials at the country level – a dedicated, independent role in coordinating the activities of all the various UN entities working on behalf of people across the world locally, which make up UN Country Teams.

<p style='text-align: justify;'><font size="-1"><em>Instruction: </em></font></p>

With the reform, the functions of the Resident Coordinator are now separated from those of the resident representative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP).-->
