summary: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The year 2019 has already brought a plethora of new and revised indicators for development financing flows, taking the quality and effectiveness component explicitly into account. Which further insights do we thus get into commitments of major DAC donors to sustainable change?</p>"
---

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The development effectiveness debate is finally gaining momentum again and global indicators increasingly incorporate quality components of financing for development flows. While the quantity still matters, a deeper policy analysis might reveal gaps in partners' policy coherence and commitment for enabling long-term change. Which country is taking development effectiveness seriously? And how do country rankings differ across indicators?</p>

## Indicators increasingly capture quality of financing

<p style='text-align: justify;'>For the present analysis, I will benchmark the Commitment to Development Index (US-based Center for Global Development) and the Principled Aid Index (UK-based Overseas Development Institute) against the most common measure for financing flows: ODA in per cent of countries' Gross National Income published by the OECD. As these indexes are not easily comparable with regards to their impact towards quality of financing, I will only compare the countries' ranking for each index.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li><p style='text-align: justify;'><b>ODA indicator:</b> The best-known indicator for financial flows in international development cooperation is Official Development Assistance (ODA) by the OECD. After almost half a century in practice, the OECD launched in the beginning of April a new indicator series to capture the qualitative part of the ODA indicator. The new grant equivalent measure gives further insights into donor efforts as the grant equivalents instead of cash flows of concessional loans are recorded. The ODA basically measures how much aid is provided at government level in per cent of Gross National Income, (to account for different economic sizes of countries).</p></li>

    <li><p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Commitment to Development Index:</b> The Commitment to Development Index is an annual measure for the development-friendliness of 27 OECD-DAC donors published by the Center for Global Development. Introduced in 2003, it has since analyzed governments' dedication to ensure that their policies indeed contribute the development and growth of countries. Based on results obtained from seven distinct policy areas (Aid Finance, Technology, Environment, Trade, Security and Migration), an average indicator is calculated. In each of these areas, the think tank rewards good practices (e.g. low tariffs for emerging economies) and punishes current bad processes (e.g. high CO2 emissions) of partner countries.</p></li>

    <!--However, ... // This is measured by taking into account in equal parts quantity (relying on ODA measurements and the 0.7% target), and aid quality. // satisfy all dimensions/donor coordination. Interestingly, the ODA forms part of the two-fold "aid finance" indicator (quantity), while quality measured by QuODA (see textbox). // **QuODA - Quality of Development Aid** (Center for Global Development and Brookings Institution) is a subindicator of the CDI. The CDI of the Center for Global Development embarks 7 dimensions. One dimension that we are interested in is aid.  To better capture and compare aid quality (which is a difficult task), the CGDev and Brookings Institution came up with the measure QuODA (Quality of Development Aid) in 20XX to track high aid-quality (but again only supart). Baed on 24 indicators, grouped into four dimensions, 27 bilateral and 13 multilateral donors are regularly analyzed. The important dimensions are: maximizing efficiency, fostering institutions, reducing the burden on recipient countries, and transparency and learning (and pricinples of high-level meetings have been used for that). The final score is the simple average of the standardized indicators.</p></li>-->

    <li><p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Principled Aid Index:</b> The Principled Aid Index aims at taking into account governments' long-term dedications to sustainable development rather than short-sighted returns. It claims to compare "rhetoric to reality, and deeds to declarations", while at the same time emphasizing the mutual benefits of ODA. Centered around 12 indicators in three dimensions (Countries that need it most, global cooperation and public-spirited focus on impact), the Principled Aid Index compares policies and actions of 29 DAC donors.</p></li>

</ul>

<!-- Important to ratify international agreements, while not undermining parter countries' ability to develop sustainable public policy // South Korea, Norway, and Portugal are top performers on the technology component. All three countries are committed to high levels of government and incentives for business expenditure on R&D. South Korea’s policy environment supports business expenditures on R&D of over 3 percent of GDP, and the direct government support to R&D reaches 1.5 percent of GDP. // New Zealand’s legislation on intellectual property rights (IPR) is the most development friendly, followed by Canada. // Rich countries are most responsible for climate change, but poorer countries will suffer most.

Sweden scores highest overall on the migration component, strengthened by its integration policies and acceptance of refugees and migrants from poorer countries. Germany, ranking second overall on migration, accepts most refugees, Austria has the most generous rate of accepting asylum seekers.

Germany good job in migration and trade, but aid quality and international security.... could be better. largest donor in absolute terms (US) ranks 23rd of 27 (but does much to global security in terms of protection, but not ratifying international agreements - so kind of ambivalent behavior and only what is benefitting them). In terms of financing, has highest room for improvement, especially related to bilateral aid. "while few countries are strong on both quantity and quality of aid". New Zealand ranks highest overall in aid quality, with extremely effective bilateral aid. South Korea, Japan, and Canada disburse aid to the most effective multilateral institutions. last countries are Poland, Greece, and South Korea - but still true they can be good in single categories (e.g. South Korea ranks last on the CDI. Its performance on trade, environment, and security are the lowest in the CDI. However, with its extraordinary support for innovation and research and development, it maintains its position at the top of the technology component.)</p>

<!-- The results also highlight what many countries can and should improve on: eliminating tied aid and enhancing the use of recipient country systems and priorities. -->

## Comparing indicators reveal variations for major DAC donors

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Overall, these indexes are only partly overlapping in their countries' rankings. Baltic countries perform very well in all three indices. Sweden claims the first place in both the ODA indicator and Commitment to Development Index, while reaching the third place in the Principled Aid Index. On average, Western European countries rank among the top. Interestingly, the bottom five countries mostly from South and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Greece, Slovakia) do not show much variation in the positioning. High differences are displayed for major traditional donors. In the Prinicpled Aid Index, the USA and Japan perform significantly better, while Germany reaches only place 15 (compared to e.g. place 4 in the Commitment to Development Index). The better performance of Japan in this index matches with the revised ODA definition, where its grant-equivalent ODA rose 41% versus the cash-flow measure. In the Commitment to Development Index, it however scores only place 24. Significant outliers in the Commitment to Development Index are Portugal and Austria (performing better) and Switzerland (reaching a low record).</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Where does this comparison leave us? It is of course a challenge for partner countries to commit aid and financing flows to so many diverse sectors and countries, while at the same time having to adhere to (sometimes contradicting) principles. Yet, these measures nevertheless reveal that there are countries that take the sustainable development commitment more seriously than others. Baltic countries score high in all three rankings, whereas countries from Southern and Eastern Europe lag behind in quality commitments. Other major governments seem to be operating well in areas important to them, while ignoring other policy areas. The USA is for instance cashing out a lot of money in absolute terms, yet does not seem committed to principled aid. While Germany performs well in the migration sector (mainly due to large in-donor refugee costs), it could improve its performance in development effectiveness. There is thus a lot of room and space for improvement, and the dimensions of the presented indicators make an important contribution in identifying challenges ahead at country level.</p>
