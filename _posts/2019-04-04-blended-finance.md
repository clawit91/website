It is no new news that there is a financing gap in development cooperation. but shocking figures are now available in times of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. But call for innovative finance instruments have been in discussion since the UN Conferences in Monterrey (2002) and Doha (2008) at the latest, innovative instruments have been seen as part of Financing for Development (FfD). One particular often named instrument is blended finance. Where can it be group in the class of innovative instruments, what are its characteristics, and what are policy and implementing challenges?

## Innovative instruments, blended finance and structured funds

There are three groups of innovative financing mechanisms that can be outlined along the scale and scope, and who pays how much (for an excellent introduction in German, see this )

1) Generating new revenues (e.g. taxes, auctions of rights of use, additional market funds)
2) using public funds as a catalyst for private capital, e.g.

-	Public-private-partnerships
-	Using financial intermediaries
-	Blended Finance: mixing public and private money (and structured funds are one way)
-  risk assumption or guarantees by the state (= commercial pre-financing of the use of budget funds, e.g. in the health or agricultural sector)


//////////////////
How does blended finance work?
*** blending/concessional loans through a mixture of public and private funds, e.g. interest rate cuts (state subsidies can be used to lower interest rates for developing countries, e.g. 4-10 times)
*** loans/bonds with performance-linked payments (in bad years the country pays less)

*** securitisation/structured funds (the risk is structured), often for refinancing (micro)financial institutions in partner countries, but only with a good local financial market
- first loss/EK tranche (5%) (dimensioned in such a way that experience shows that it covers all expected loan defaults and still has a good safety cushion), donor countries with good ratings ???
- mezzanine (15%), financial cooperation means, e.g. by kfw, EIB, IFC (WorldBank)…
3rd Senior (80%), lower interest rates from private contributors


--> If there is a fallout, banks and senior level are the last ones to pay, waterfall principle

- Potential: contribute to SDG financing, creating employment opportunities, and strengthening local financial systems
- Opportunities:
    •	Small investors in risky country settings, dedicate to smaller enterprises
    •	More countries, banks and final customers
    •	Also using local investors
- Risk: unclear impact, big knowledge gap
_	Strategic: Marshall Plan
_ Working: minimizing risk of fallout based on public guarantees and crossborder cooperation

	Charactersitics:
•	HQ
•	Instruments
•	Length
•	Investors
•	Structuring
•	Legal form

- ethical funds.
... and many more

3) more efficient utilisation approaches in the use of funds (efficiency increases/debt transformations)


## Examples / reality check /

Textbox: Blended finance in Germany:

Durch die Beimischung von Marktmitteln konnte das Gesamtvolumen der Kreditzusagen im Rahmen der finanziellen Zusammenarbeit in den vergangenen Jahren erheblich gesteigert werden.

(in Mrd. €)	Mittel aus dem Bundeshaushalt bei kfw Zusagen  	Beimischung von Marktmitteln	Gesamt
2001	1 (63%)	0,6 (38%)	1,6
2011	1,9 (42%)	2,6 (58%)	4,5
Veränderung	+90%	+333%	+181%

Box: Blended finance in Germany: official cooperation with kfw:
Insgesamt konnte die KfW Entwicklungsbank von 2001 bis 2011 zusätzlich zu den Steuergeldern mehr als 13,6 Milliarden Euro Marktmittel für die Entwicklungs- und Schwellenländer bereitstellen. Dies beinhaltet auch Kredite zu konzessionären Konditionen aus reinen Marktmitteln – also ohne den Einsatz von Mitteln aus dem BMZ-Haushalt (sogenannte FZ-Förderkredite). Diese werden seit 2012 zudem durch die Bundesregierung garantiert, wenn sie die Kriterien der ODA (Official Development Assistance) erfüllen.

## Criticism on structured funds/blended finance

-	Impact is unclear, European Parliament recommended in 2014 to divert from structured funds to capacity-building
-	Often not benefitting SMEs (who are targeted)
-	Financial paradise
-	Missing out LDCs
-	Unclear whether human rights and hygiene standards are actually considered and respected
-	Weak transparency and accountability
-	Is it really additional to public resources?
-	Reality of Aid (=Southern-led network) ciritices the use of blended finance, e.g. in Cameroon

--> give examples of when it worked and when it didn't work!!!

## What are policy implications of blended finance?

In view of the lack of definition and non-exisiting rules, there arise some policy immplications.

Impact and dimensions: Check whether the goals are the same, as normally profit is 1-dimensonal, but SDGs are 3-dimensional, also ecological and social impact

<p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Ensure that blended reaches those furthest behind:</b> It should not divert from: macro level (type and country): LDCs (7% of private finance in 2012-2015, in 2017 2% of FDI), Country-programmable aid (where countries have a share in saying what should be done) micro level: Social sectors</p>

Ensure accessibility and affordability of services: Private sector may lack incentives to do so...

Link blended financing to existing structures: Local context (e.g. employment, local production chains // not creating monopolies // enable technology transfer,

Further study, understand and evaluate impact on: Local economy // Social groups

Check structuring of risk: is it good that way it is?

Everyone is keen on doing it: Different sets of principles, e.g. OECD, G20, AAAA, Nairobi…
