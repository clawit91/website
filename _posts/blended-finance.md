It is no new news that there is a financing gap in development cooperation. So the smartest heads are puttung their heads together to come up with ideas for innvative finance - acutally already in but shocking figures are now available in times of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. But call for innovative finance instruments have been in discussion since the UN Conferences in Monterrey (2002) and Doha (2008) at the latest, innovative instruments have been seen as part of Financing for Development (FfD). One particular often named instrument is blended finance. Where can it be group in the class of innovative instruments, what are its characteristics, and what are policy and implementing challenges?

Blended finance?

## Innovative instruments, blended finance and structured funds

Blended finance is a part of innovative financing mechanisms where public funds are used to private capital. (other story: generating new revenues e.g. auctions of rights of use), these could be e.g. also traditoinal public private parternships. Often it means that blendinc concessional loans with interest rates cates (where states subsidies can be used to lower interest rates for developing countries), or loans/bonds with performance-linked payments (in bad years country pays less). Another way is just to structure risk. This is then called structured funds or securitisation.

Where? often for refinancing (micro)financial institutions in partner countries, but only with a good local financial market

How?

- first loss/EK tranche (5%) (dimensioned in such a way that experience shows that it covers all expected loan defaults and still has a good safety cushion), donor countries with good ratings ???
- mezzanine (15%), financial cooperation means, e.g. by kfw, EIB, IFC (WorldBank)…
3rd Senior (80%), lower interest rates from private contributors


--> If there is a fallout, banks and senior level are the last ones to pay, waterfall principle

- Potential: contribute to SDG financing, creating employment opportunities, and strengthening local financial systems
- Opportunities:
    •	Small investors in risky country settings, dedicate to smaller enterprises
    •	More countries, banks and final customers
    •	Also using local investors
- Risk: unclear impact, big knowledge gap
_	Strategic: Marshall Plan
_ Working: minimizing risk of fallout based on public guarantees and crossborder cooperation

	Charactersitics:
•	HQ
•	Instruments
•	Length
•	Investors
•	Structuring
•	Legal form






To reduce the shortfalls in funding for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), donor countries are being urged to make greater use of innovative financing mechanisms and instruments in development financing, which in addition to public funds increasingly includes the mobilisation of private resources.

A major obstacle to private-sector investment in development-related projects in developing countries is the fact that these investments are often considered too risky. Every investment involves financial risk, but in developing and emerging countries, this is often seen as prohibitively high.

At the same time, many of today’s political and economic challenges are global in nature. They cannot be addressed through ‘isolated solutions’, and instead require cooperation beyond national borders. This is true of, for example, the expansion of sustainable energy supply or better access to the capital market.

In light of these challenges, structured funds are used in the field of development cooperation to mobilise private resources on a transnational basis for the purposes of development support. As part of cooperation with regions, structured funds are used in various regional and sectoral contexts and are considered to offer great potential for the financing of the SDGs.

A key characteristic of structured funds is that losses are covered to a certain amount by public donors, thus mitigating the risk for private investors. This is intended to encourage private investors to invest more in development-related projects. Most structured funds are also supported by technical cooperation with a view to reducing capacity-related risks and ensuring compliance with environmental, social and governance standards.
Goals of the evaluation

The number of structured funds involving German development cooperation has risen steadily in recent years. Around EUR 800 million in German federal budgetary resources and around EUR 500 million in KfW funds are paid into these funds. However, very little is currently known about the impact of structured funds. The objectives of the evaluation are therefore as follows:

- Position structured funds within the objectives of German development cooperation and analyse if fonds are a suitable finance intrument to reach the objectives

- Analysis of the implementation of development principles (division of labour, donor harmonisation, strengthening of regional actors)

- Analysis of the contribution to mobilising additional funds/sustainability of the financing structures

- Analysis of the effects on portfolio quality and abilities to reach end-beneficiaries

- Analysis of the effects on MSME development
Methods

The evaluation questions will be answered using a theory-based approach.

Based on a mixed method approach, a combination of quasi-experimental design and qualitative case studies will be used to examine the development impact of structured funds. When combined, the quasi-experiments and qualitative comparative case studies can be used to identify causal links and thus explain why specific effects were observed.

- ethical funds.
... and many more

3) more efficient utilisation approaches in the use of funds (efficiency increases/debt transformations)


## Examples / reality check /

Textbox: Blended finance in Germany:

Durch die Beimischung von Marktmitteln konnte das Gesamtvolumen der Kreditzusagen im Rahmen der finanziellen Zusammenarbeit in den vergangenen Jahren erheblich gesteigert werden.

(in Mrd. €)	Mittel aus dem Bundeshaushalt bei kfw Zusagen  	Beimischung von Marktmitteln	Gesamt
2001	1 (63%)	0,6 (38%)	1,6
2011	1,9 (42%)	2,6 (58%)	4,5
Veränderung	+90%	+333%	+181%

Box: Blended finance in Germany: official cooperation with kfw:
Insgesamt konnte die KfW Entwicklungsbank von 2001 bis 2011 zusätzlich zu den Steuergeldern mehr als 13,6 Milliarden Euro Marktmittel für die Entwicklungs- und Schwellenländer bereitstellen. Dies beinhaltet auch Kredite zu konzessionären Konditionen aus reinen Marktmitteln – also ohne den Einsatz von Mitteln aus dem BMZ-Haushalt (sogenannte FZ-Förderkredite). Diese werden seit 2012 zudem durch die Bundesregierung garantiert, wenn sie die Kriterien der ODA (Official Development Assistance) erfüllen.

## Criticism on structured funds/blended finance

-	Impact is unclear, European Parliament recommended in 2014 to divert from structured funds to capacity-building
-	Often not benefitting SMEs (who are targeted)
-	Financial paradise
-	Missing out LDCs
-	Unclear whether human rights and hygiene standards are actually considered and respected
-	Weak transparency and accountability
-	Is it really additional to public resources?
-	Reality of Aid (=Southern-led network) ciritices the use of blended finance, e.g. in Cameroon

--> give examples of when it worked and when it didn't work!!!

## What are policy implications of blended finance?

In view of the lack of definition and non-exisiting rules, there arise some policy immplications, as indicated by the Development Cooperation Forum:

Impact and dimensions: Check whether the goals are the same, as normally profit is 1-dimensonal, but SDGs are 3-dimensional, also ecological and social impact

<p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Ensure that blended finance reaches those furthest behind:</b> It is imperative that LDCs should not be forgetten. From 2012-2015, only 7% went to LDCs. As well, should not only focus on infrastructure, but where appropriate, also social sectors.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Link blended financing to existing structures: Local context (e.g. employment, local production chains // not creating monopolies // enable technology transfer, but also means checking affordability and accessibility of services.</p>

Further study, understand and evaluate impact on: Local economy // Social groups

Check structuring of risk: is it good that way it is?

Everyone is keen on doing it: Different sets of principles, e.g. OECD, G20, AAAA, Nairobi…



### in Germany

Within financial cooperation, such structured funds have enabled €3.60 of additional public funds and €4.80 of additional private capital to be mobilised for every euro from the federal budget contributed between 2005 and the end of 2010. https://www.bmz.de/en/issues/development-financing/innovative-development-financing-instruments/Mobilising-private-investors/index.html

The monies from structured funds are usually used for private finance institutions in the cooperation countries. They enable these institutions to make loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and private individuals. The public monies are not used up by the funds but are reused when the loans are repaid; this approach provides a revolving source of capital.

Structured  funds  operate  in  a  similar  fashion  to   the   securities   described   above;   but   in   addition  to  providing  security  against  future  revenues,  these  structure  the  risk  as  well.  The overall risk is divided into tranches, each with  different  degrees  of  risk,  and  these  are  passed on to investors with varying risk appe-tites.   This   means   that,   ultimately,   private   capital  is  mobilised  to  finance  development  processes. In  development  cooperation,  this  instrument  is   often   used   when   refinancing   financialinstitutions   (including   microfinance   institu-tions)  in  partner  countries.  Hence  the  (micro)  loans   issued   by   local   financial   institutions   serve to secure the international loan granted to   the   finance   institution   itself.   In   simple   terms,  this  international  loan  is  divided  into  three  tranches:  the  “first  loss”  tranche,  the  “mezzanine” tranche and the “senior” tranche



1) Investoren gehen auch in kleinere und riskantere Länder?
2) viel mehr Länder, Banken und Kunden
3) lokale Investoren werden erreicht
