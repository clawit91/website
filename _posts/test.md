Recognizing the importance of digitalization and big data in ensuring ... Implementing information and communication technologies can be a sustainable and smart solution. Current projects such as blockchain, M-Pesa, or the use of satellites to improve monitoring and data collection at household level are proven powerful tools. At the same time, it has to be ensured that access to these technologies and innovations is widely shared and not restricted to countries with a certain cash portfolio.

The indicators include some things which are firmly backed by evidence. For example, tied aid (aid that must be spent on goods and services from the donor country) can increase the costs of a project by up to 30 percent. Many indicators have a sound theoretical base—for example, giving transparently, and in countries or sectors where the donor has a specialisation, or avoiding giving aid through a large number of agencies (potentially making it complex and burdensome for recipients).

Some of the indicators are juxtaposed. In particular, the share spent in poorer countries (where it could make more difference) and the share to well-governed countries (which we expect to increase aid effectiveness). It’s hard to do well in both.

DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS AGENDA

In a brief recap at the 2018 Development Cooperation Forum, Jonathan Glennie and José Antonio Alonso presented their thoughts on what had changed within the last decade, and on what needs to change.

One way is to look at indicators associated with effective aid. The OECD donor countries agreed on a number of principles and measures in a series of high-level meetings on aid effectiveness that culminated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), the Accra Agenda for Action (2008), and the Busan Partnership Agreement (2011).

## Why quality, and not quantity matters

It should come at no surprise that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development demands more liable action., and policy coherence on the ground - both from countries providing international financing and those receiving it. So should have one harmonized approach, discussed. Yet, reality is different.
* 2030 agenda
* policy coherence
* not only "taschenfüllend - und bereichernd" - making a real change and contributing to sustainable development in partner countries
* focus on Germany (since major OECD Donor country in absolute terms, and since it is where I am from )


<p style='text-align: justify;'>Following the huge development effectiveness debate in the beginning of the new millennium, focus has subdued (potentially crisis, no policy coherence, unclear what new future would bring), as also confirmed in countless summaries and reports of the Development Cooperation Forum which calls for stepping up the game. OECD has heard the calls and finally changed its practice. So, here we want to compare some indices on aid quality and compare them: // We will now compare the TOP 27 of each index - and will check whether they are kind of telling the same story or not. Here is a short overview of the four indexes we will look into, and by whom they are published. It is of course difficult to compare indicators per se, but we will take a closer look into the different rankings of countries and what it means.</p> Let us thus rank OECD-DAC countries with indicators from well known international organizations and

‘How do we assess entire countries? One way is to look at indicators associated with effective aid. The OECD donor countries agreed on a number of principles and measures in a series of high-level meetings on aid effectiveness that culminated in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), the Accra Agenda for Action (2008), and the Busan Partnership Agreement (2011). Our CGD and Brookings colleagues—led by Nancy Birdsall and Homi Kharas—developed QuODA by calculating indicators based largely on these principles and grouping them into four themes: maximising efficiency, fostering institutions, reducing burdens, and transparency and learning.’

duo: definition of development cooperation in a new context?
Jonathan Glennie
José Antonio Alonso (Applied Economics, Complutense ...)

Prof. José Antonio Alonso, Professor of Applied Economics, Complutense University
Four issues (looking into the past)
1) first initiatives, both developing and developed countries collaborated and financed, but developing -... reduced to ODA (open into finance+control), multilateral in origin, then bilateral system - OECD
2) upsize and democratize development cooperation system - to all donoros and reciepitns, not being an exclusive club, set of shared objectives, civil society organizations - how to coordinate all actors?
3) DC goes beyond money, mobilizing political will, improving tax coordination, defining a fair mechanism for e.g. debt )not requiring muc money, but very effective and with high leverage), also respecting national development cooperaton policies (not only, 0.7% of GNI, but also ...??) 99% of what? domestic agenda
4) ODA is small but important part, unique .... , can have huge public gains even if no private gains achieved , new mantra to leverage private resources

bolder voices of Southern voices
Paris principles, much less discussion of ownerships

## What could potential actions be?

* Country Programmable Aid = portion of aid that providers can programme for individual countries or regions, and over which partner countries could have a significant say. Developed in 2007, CPA is a closer proxy of aid that goes to partner countries than the concept of official development assistance (ODA)  but it is rather recipients’ view

-	Examples of key actions that could be taken include ensuring that at least 50% of ODA is targeted at LDCs or reversing the trend of strictly earmarking the aid that goes to multilateral institutions.
-	Examples of key actions that could be taken to reverse this trend would include committing to formally and informally untying all aid and increasing the share of ODA that is spent in recipient countries
-	Donors should cultivate new relationships and mechanisms within the OECD DAC to advance principled aid

take also recommendations from the CGDev
