# Current contributions to financing for development
* Create a world map and see which countries take part in meausrement of OECD-DAC
* Create a world map with UN contributions, take QCPR data.


# SDG financing gap and innovative financing for developemt instruments
It is estimated that the XXXto implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 17 indicators that track progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, requires commitment from all levels, international and nationa, public and private. This is contrasted by CCC that the global financing for sustainable development system is currently providing, leading to an estimated SDG financing gap of XXX.To finance sustainable development and to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, an unprecedented amount of money is needed.
But where is the money supposed to come from?

To learn more about Financing for Development, I recommend the Massive Open Onlien Course provided by the World Bank Group.
Here is the Website of the OECD on FFD: http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/

Using billions in Official Development Assistance (ODA) to unlock and mobilize trillions of dollars needed from all sources of finance.
Tax, investment, aid, philanthropy, remittances... No single source of financing is enough to deliver the 2030 Agenda.
Those flows are all very different in nature, involve different sets of actors and have different effects: they do not simply “add up” for sustainable development.
But deliberate action by governments and private stakeholders can help maximise their synergies, support national and regional strategies efficiently, and amplify the positive outcomes on people’s well-being.


# Development cooperation evolved, but no one notices

As an economist specialized in development cooperation, I am often asked by friends and family what I specifically do. I often encounter two challenges:

1) Development aid vs. development Cooperation: Why we shouldn't use the term any longer - looking also from a historical stance.
2) Missing public attention about SDGs: what can we do? MDGs were known, but SDGs address us in a even more profound manner.

# ABC of development Cooperation


Finance for development is rapidly evolving. Along with those changes have come not only a host of new instruments, but also a new lexicon.

As development is increasingly funded in partnership with the private sector, finance-based instruments are becoming part of the mix, bringing with them terms that are adapted to the new context.

#### Untied aid
#### Policy coherence
#### Financing for Development
#### Development finance
#### programme-based approaches
not a proper term,

Which ones are available? Who came up with which idea? Who is interested in creating them? Governments (from South?), scientists? Are they realistic? What should they take into account, how can they be classified?
