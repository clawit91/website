<p class="justify"> Recognizing the need of eradicating inequality in all its dimensions, fighting risks of climate change, and ensuring that no one is left behind, I am highly dedicated to contributing to the achievement of the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations. This blog will provide opinions and ideas on a broad range of international development cooperation topics, related to the interaction between a variety of actors, instruments and initiatives. All views expressed are mine. Happy reading!</p>
