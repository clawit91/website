<p class="justify"> Recognizing the need of eradicating poverty in all its dimensions, fighting risks of climate change, and ensuring that no one is left behind, I am highly dedicated to contribute to achieving the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations. To analyze and enable the highest impact of policies, programmes and initiatives, I have specialized in effective development cooperation, monitoring and evaluation of projects on the ground and innovative technology solutions with a focus on transformative South-led processes.
