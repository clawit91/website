<p class="justify">What motivates a theoretical economist to switch from building models to working in development cooperation? My Eureka moment was when reading an <a href="https://economics.hse.ru/data/2016/03/11/1124888188/gpol12032.pdf" target="_blank"><u>academic paper</u></a> by Branko Milanovic on global inequality during my studies of economics, in which he claims that a "very large chunk of our income will be determined by only one variable, which generally we acquire at birth: citizenship." Intrigued by this hypothesis, reflecting my own migration Polish background, and motivated to get to the bottom of the cause, I have since combined my economic background and interest in international development to contribute to decreasing inequality.</p>

<p class="justify">My holistic overview of international development cooperation is based on insights from an implementing, political and academic angle. Dedicated to creating impact, I have specialized in the monitoring and evaluation of projects at the macro and micro level, including in-depth questionnaire design, intergovernmental outreach and data analysis. Building upon my quick comprehension of facts, I have worked on topics ranging from development financing to transformative processes, and authored reports, policy briefs and book chapters. Successful collaborations and assignments include:
