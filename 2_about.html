<p class="justify">Motivated by a constant thrive to explore new challenges, I have volunteered in numerous positions. In February 2018, I planned and organized a <a href="https://blockchainforthesdgs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><u>public panel discussion</u></a> in New York on the role of blockchain technology in achieving the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals, and authored a <a href="https://www.stiftung-mercator.de/de/publikation/blockchain-new-avenues-for-the-sdgs/" target="_blank"><u>conference paper</u></a>. In my position as a jury member for  <a href="https://www.studieren-ohne-grenzen.org/en/projekte/dr-kongo-kindu/hintergrund/" target="_blank"><u>Studieren ohne Grenzen</u></a>, I critically assessed applications in French from Congolese students for a scholarship program. To shope the scholarship’s council of the Foundation of German Business in its third and fourth year, I steered the public relations and initiated knowledge management structures.</p>

<p class="justify">Intrigued by studying the unfair evolution of global inequality levels during my studies of economics and motivated to get to the bottom of the cause, I put emphasis on development economics and behavioral economics in order to understand how choices and policies are shaped. To put this theory into praxis, I applied my knowledge in development-related research institutions on the ground such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) in Cambodia, the Center for Development Research (ZEF), and the German Development Institute (DIE). </p>
