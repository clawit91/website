<p class="justify">I'm a versatile economist and international development expert focusing on effectiveness principles and development finance. My unique strength lies in synthesizing rigorous exploratory data analysis into concise policy recommendations targeted to different audiences. I am passionate about innovative data visualizations tools and designs to create engaging reports and studies. As a freelance data and policy analyst at the United Nations, the GFA Consulting Group and adelphi, I have professional experience in collaborating with high-level government officials, representatives from international organizations, the civil society, and the private sector.</p>

<p class="justify">Intrigued by studying the unfair evolution of global inequality levels during my studies of economics and motivated to get to the bottom of the cause, I put emphasis on development economics and behavioral economics in order to understand how choices and policies are shaped. To put this theory into praxis, I applied my knowledge in development-related research institutions on the ground such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) in Cambodia, the Center for Development Research (ZEF), and the German Development Institute (DIE). </p>

<p class="justify">Motivated by a constant thrive to explore new challenges, I have volunteered in numerous positions. In February 2018, I planned and organized a <a href="https://blockchainforthesdgs.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><u>public panel discussion</u></a> in New York on the role of blockchain technology in achieving the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals. This included identifying and liaising with renowned panelists, moderating the discussion and authoring a <a href="https://www.stiftung-mercator.de/de/publikation/blockchain-new-avenues-for-the-sdgs/" target="_blank"><u>conference paper</u></a>. In my position as a jury member for  <a href="https://www.studieren-ohne-grenzen.org/en/projekte/dr-kongo-kindu/hintergrund/" target="_blank"><u>Studieren ohne Grenzen</u></a>, I critically assessed applications in French from Congolese students for a scholarship program, who aim to support the reconstruction of their war-torn country. To give scholars of  the Foundation of German Business a broader voice, I shaped the young scholarship’s council as a re-elected member in its third and fourth year. To increase visibility among scholarship holders and the foundation, I steered the public relations, and initiated knowledge management structures.</p>
